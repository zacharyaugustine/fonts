#Open-source fonts for web and print
maintained by [Zachary G. Augustine](http://zacharyaugustine.com)

###Using fonts
To use a font on a desktop computer, download and [install](http://www.dafont.com/faq.php) the file.

*Font files in various formats and versions are available directly or stored in GitHub repositories. I've tried to link them below.*

To use a font on the web, first download and add a font file to your website's CSS folder. In your CSS stylesheet, you must then [declare](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webfonts/quick/) the font with a relative reference. It will then be accessible through normal CSS styling.

*To conserve bandwidth, use few fonts and as few styles of each font as possible -- each must be loaded separately. Keeping track can get confusing, so you can use custom generators from Google Fonts, Font Squirrel, or similar to make lightweight versions for you. I've tried to link them below.*

There can be a lot going on, so stay organized:
- bookmark EVERYTHING -- plain text lists are not enough
- get a free GitHub account, 'Star' repositories and 'Follow' designers
- keep an organized folder in Google Drive or Dropbox
- use a font management program
